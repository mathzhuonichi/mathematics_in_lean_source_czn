Logic
=====

In the last chapter, we dealt with equations, inequalities,
and basic mathematical statements like
":math:`x` divides :math:`y`."
Complex mathematical statements are built up from
simple ones like these
using logical terms like "and," "or," "not," and
"if ... then," "every," and "some."
In this chapter, we show you how to work with statements
that are built up in this way.
